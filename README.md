## Importing from hydrus:

### Ratings:

Before doing your tag-file mapping export, convert all your ratings into tags in Hydrus by looking up each individual rating in system:rating and applying a distinct tag to it, once you are in garo you will be able to take this tag, search it and rate all selected images with it and then remove the tag. 

### Tag-File Mappings:

To import tag-file mappings from hydrus into b-hydrus, open hydrus and select all of your files, then right click a file and click into the share->export files button.

A limitation of the import is that which hydrus file service your image is in, or which hydrus tag service your tag is in is lost. To counteract this you can mark every file in a specific file service with a tag, and then move every file with that tag into a separate file (taggable) service after importing. With tags there is no real way around this unless you know how to script a namespace to the front of each tag, I do not intend to add this functionality for the time being

Change the export path to either be to the database\import-from-hydrus\file-tag-mappings folder if you are doing this on the computer hosting the server. Or to wherever you want if you are importing from another computer.

Change the filenames field to "{hash}"

Click the no sidecars button (the button above export, if you already have sidecars), empty the edit metadata migration routers then click the import button and with the following string in your clipboard (i.e. your current Ctrl+C copy text) click import from clipboard "[26, 3, [[2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [111, 3, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], "616c6c206b6e6f776e2074616773", 0]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "tags", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [120, 1, [84, 1, [26, 3, []]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "notes", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [118, 2, [84, 1, [26, 3, []]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "urls", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [5, null, null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "arctime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [1, null, null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "modtime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [3, "6c6f63616c2066696c6573", null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "imptime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [4, "6c6f63616c2066696c6573", null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "deltime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [7, "6c6f63616c2066696c6573", null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "pimtime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]], [2, [109, 2, [[26, 3, [[2, [123, 1, [[84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [121, 2, [6, 0, null]]]]]]], [84, 1, [26, 3, []]], [116, 3, [false, "lavtime", [55, 2, [[], "0123456789abcdef.jpg.txt"]], "\n"]]]]]]]"

After this is done exporting to the folder, if you are importing from the computer hosting the server you can run the hydrus-migrate program, if you are importing from another computer, you will need to ZIP this file as a .zip (no other ZIP style extensions are allowed, sorry), and if it is over 2GB you will need to split the ZIP into 2GB increments (you can do this using 7zip) and then import it using the File->Import Files from Hydrus service in your browser.

After this step, there will be certain namespaces that are incorrect as a result of any tag with a colon in it being recognized as a namespace, you can fix this by going into Tags->Namespaces and clicking the convert to tag prefix option on the incorrect namespaces
